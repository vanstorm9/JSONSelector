# JSONSelector
JSONSelector script

This is a script that selects sections of JSON data based on an input string specifying specific JSON attributes that one wants to retrieve.

To run this script, you would run:
```
    python main.py
```

An input prompt will ask you to input a string for the JSON parser to use to search for sections of a JSON file.


This script is capable of single selectors




It is also capable of compound selectors




And selector chains

This can even handle compound selector chains (though this part may be buggy):
